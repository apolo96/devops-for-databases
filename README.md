# DevOps for Databases

It is about extending the DevOps capabilities to Database Management.

## Getting started

You go to setting the environment vars for the MYSQL Database.

First, copy the `mysql.example.env` file.

```bash
cp mysql.example.env mysql.env
```
Now, setting the MYSQL_DATABASE and MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD in `mysql.env`

Then, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Finally, you can ask the workshop instructor about the next steps.
